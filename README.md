# wp-api-plugins-themes-endpoints

Feature plugin for Plugins and Themes Endpoints

This project is **archived and unmaintained**. For information on core WordPress REST API theme support, see the [REST API handbook page on the `themes/` endpoint](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/themes/). While less far-reaching than the experiements here, the core endpoints will be maintained and expanded going forward, while this repository will not.
